# hello-world
(My tutorial to Git since I'm completely new to it lol, yeah I need to learn this.)

Ayo, justabluemouse here.
I just logged in to GitHub mostly because of sm64js.com(because those fools be out there making a fricking Super Mario 64 MMO PC port XD), but I do hope I can actually learn how to do Git later, because it looks really cool, and you'd get major respect. I'm usually on my Pixilart account: pixilart.com/justabluemouse, so feel free to talk to me on there.

Peace out for now,
Justabluemouse
